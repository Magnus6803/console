Gonsole - Integrated Console Application library
=========

This package rests on a [readline](https://github.com/maxlandon/readline) console library, (giving advanced completion, hint, input and history system), 
and the [go-flags](https://github.com/jessievdk/go-flags) commands library. Also added, a bit of optional boilerplate for better user experience.

The purpose of this library is to offer a complete off-the-shelf console application, with some key aspects: 
- Better overall features than what is currently seen in such projects, including those not written in Go.
- A really simple but very powerful way of transforming code (structs and anything they might embed), into commands.
- An equally simple way to provide completions for any command/subcommand, any arguments of them, or any option arguments.
